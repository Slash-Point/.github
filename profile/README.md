# Welcome to Slash Point

Slash Point is committed to fostering a community driven effort to secure todays future. Together we will empower organizations to build trustworthy AI models and respect individual rights to data privacy. Our expansion strategy, driven by client acquisition, userbase growth, and strategic partnerships, will position us at the forefront of the AI and data protection domain.

Open Source AI/ML Auditing
----
The goal of this organization is to publish code and innovate on existing techinques to ensure AI models follow these proposed guidlines:

1.1 AI Model Auditing:
-   Detection of personal information exposure: Identify instances where AI models reveal personally identifiable information (PII) and provide recommendations for mitigation.
-   Identification of harmful information generated by the model: Evaluate model outputs for potential risks, such as biased, discriminatory, or malicious content.
-   Assessment of intentional evasion of auditing and user privacy protection laws: Analyze the training process and model behavior to assess if there are deliberate attempts to evade audits and privacy protection laws.

1.2 Data Protection Measures:

-   Encryption standards: Implement industry-leading encryption algorithms and protocols to secure data in transit and at rest.
-   Access controls: Establish role-based access controls (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive data.
-   Privacy-enhancing technologies: Utilize privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy, federated learning, and secure multi-party computation, to minimize data exposure and protect user     privacy.

1.3 Mitigation of Model Leakage:
-   Hardening the input analyzer: Develop advanced techniques to identify and sanitize sensitive data inputs, reducing the risk of leakage and unintentional exposure.
